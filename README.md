# Language-Generator v1.0.0
This tool is designed to generate random words, according to defined rules. These rules can be customized by the user
to create a wide variety of different patterns. The variety of words within a rule-set is dependent on the restrictions,
that define the language.

This tool is not yet meant to serve as a dictionary. This means, that words can only be generated, but not linked to
any meaning. What you do with the generated words, is up to you.
